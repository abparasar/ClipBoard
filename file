Absolutely! Hereâ€™s how you can manually download and upload the required models for SimSwap in Google Colab:

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Download the Required Model Files

1. ArcFace Model (arcface_checkpoint.tar)
	â€¢	Download Link:https://objects.githubusercontent.com/github-production-release-asset-2e65be/374891081/f01468b3-446b-4867-8c78-6d496183f9e6?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=releaseassetproduction%2F20250426%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250426T111133Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Signature=c861ea735f7b772f110769fb64f819246fa73fc0e7f16f168cd54ae27d7ae03f&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3Darcface_checkpoint.tar&response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream
arcface_checkpoint.tar

2. SimSwap Checkpoint (epoch_00020.pth)
	â€¢	Download Link:https://objects.githubusercontent.com/github-production-release-asset-2e65be/374891081/a8dac400-dcb6-11eb-933f-977cd7f5f554?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=releaseassetproduction%2F20250426%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250426T111303Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Signature=b0670f904027b3c50393071e29d53dba446a288abd710a39feebe9750518e59f&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3Dcheckpoints.zip&response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream
epoch_00020.pth

Note: The checkpoints.zip file contains the epoch_00020.pth file. After downloading, youâ€™ll need to extract it to access the .pth file.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Upload the Files to Your Colab Session
	1.	Open your Google Colab notebook.
	2.	Run the following code to upload files:

from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()


	3.	Use the file browser that appears to upload:
	â€¢	arcface_checkpoint.tar
	â€¢	epoch_00020.pth (extracted from the checkpoints.zip)

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Place the Files in the Correct Directories

After uploading, move the files to their respective directories:

import os
import shutil

# Create directories if they don't exist
os.makedirs('arcface_model', exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs('checkpoints/people', exist_ok=True)

# Move the uploaded files to their destinations
shutil.move('arcface_checkpoint.tar', 'arcface_model/arcface_checkpoint.tar')
shutil.move('epoch_00020.pth', 'checkpoints/people/epoch_00020.pth')

âœ… Youâ€™re All Set!

With the models in place, you can proceed to run SimSwap as intended.

If you need further assistance or a ready-to-use Colab notebook with these steps integrated, feel free to ask!
