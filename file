Decision: Escalated model from limited change to Provisional Approval (PA) instead of immediate full-scope.
	•	Rationale:
	•	Allowed business to deploy with monitoring given urgency.
	•	Ensured governance by setting 6-month expiry on PA.
	•	Required a full-scope validation (with OOT and stability checks) to be completed before PA expiration.
