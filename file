Thanks — that helps narrow it down.

If the OOM is happening during fine-tuning on the DialogSum dataset, even with batch_size=1, that usually points to one (or both) of these:

⸻

Root Causes
	1.	Some dialogues are really long (over 1024 tokens) and cause a memory spike even with batch size 1.
	2.	You’re not truncating or padding properly, so sequences vary in size and can blow up VRAM.

⸻

Fix It Step-by-Step

✅ 1. Add Truncation & Padding in Preprocessing

Update your preprocess function like this:

def preprocess(example):
    model_inputs = tokenizer(
        example["dialogue"],
        max_length=512,
        padding="max_length",
        truncation=True,
    )
    
    with tokenizer.as_target_tokenizer():
        labels = tokenizer(
            example["summary"],
            max_length=64,
            padding="max_length",
            truncation=True,
        )
    
    model_inputs["labels"] = labels["input_ids"]
    return model_inputs



⸻

✅ 2. Manually Check Max Lengths (for sanity)

Run this before training:

dialogue_lengths = [len(tokenizer(dialogue)["input_ids"]) for dialogue in dataset["train"]["dialogue"]]
print("Max dialogue token length:", max(dialogue_lengths))

If you see values close to 1024+, that’s your issue.

⸻

✅ 3. Enable gradient_checkpointing

model = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_path)
model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()



⸻

✅ 4. Ensure fp16=True

When you use TrainingArguments, set:

fp16=True



⸻

Want to Test It Safely First?

Here’s a mini script to test a single training batch before running a full train:

from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

train_dataloader = DataLoader(tokenized_dataset["train"], batch_size=1)
batch = next(iter(train_dataloader))
batch = {k: v.to(model.device) for k, v in batch.items()}

outputs = model(**batch)
loss = outputs.loss
loss.backward()
print("Single batch forward + backward passed.")

If this crashes, the problem is likely input length or padding.

Would you like me to:
	•	Send a debug-ready minimal script for just one training step?
	•	Help trim the longest dialogues before training? (filter dataset)
