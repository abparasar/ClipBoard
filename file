Absolutely! Hereâ€™s how you can manually download and upload the required models for SimSwap in Google Colab:

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Download the Required Model Files

1. ArcFace Model (arcface_checkpoint.tar)
	â€¢	Download Link:
arcface_checkpoint.tar

2. SimSwap Checkpoint (epoch_00020.pth)
	â€¢	Download Link:
epoch_00020.pth

Note: The checkpoints.zip file contains the epoch_00020.pth file. After downloading, youâ€™ll need to extract it to access the .pth file.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Upload the Files to Your Colab Session
	1.	Open your Google Colab notebook.
	2.	Run the following code to upload files:

from google.colab import files

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Place the Files in the Correct Directories

After uploading, move the files to their respective directories:

import os
import shutil

# Create directories if they don't exist
os.makedirs('arcface_model', exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs('checkpoints/people', exist_ok=True)

# Move the uploaded files to their destinations
shutil.move('arcface_checkpoint.tar', 'arcface_model/arcface_checkpoint.tar')
shutil.move('epoch_00020.pth', 'checkpoints/people/epoch_00020.pth')

âœ… Youâ€™re All Set!

With the models in place, you can proceed to run SimSwap as intended.
