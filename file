Tokenization in Natural Language Processing (NLP)

What is Tokenization?
Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller meaningful pieces called tokens. These tokens are the building blocks for understanding and processing language.

⸻

Example sentence:
“Go Simran Go, live your life”

⸻

Types of Tokenization:
	•	Word-level Tokenization:
Splits text into words and punctuation based on spaces and symbols.
Tokens:
Go | Simran | Go | , | live | your | life
	•	Subword-level Tokenization:
Breaks words into smaller units (useful for rare or complex words).
Tokens:
Go | Sim | ran | Go | , | live | your | life
	•	Character-level Tokenization:
Splits text into individual characters, including spaces and punctuation.
Tokens:
G | o | (space) | S | i | m | r | a | n | (space) | G | o | …

Why is Tokenization Important?
	•	It prepares text for machine understanding
	•	Helps handle unknown or new words with subword tokens
	•	Enables efficient language processing for models
