Here are some hard Python interview questions designed to test your knowledge of advanced concepts, problem-solving skills, and the ability to write efficient and clean code:

Advanced Python Concepts
	1.	Decorators
	•	How do Python decorators work? Can you write a decorator to time the execution of a function?
	•	Can decorators take arguments? Write an example.
	2.	Metaclasses
	•	What are metaclasses in Python, and how are they used? Provide an example.
	3.	Generators and Iterators
	•	What is the difference between a generator and an iterator?
	•	How does the yield keyword work? Write a generator that generates the Fibonacci sequence.
	4.	Context Managers
	•	Explain the use of with statements in Python.
	•	How can you create a custom context manager without using @contextlib.contextmanager?
	5.	Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
	•	What is the GIL in Python? How does it affect multithreading?
	•	How can you work around GIL-related performance issues?
	6.	Data Classes
	•	What are @dataclass decorators in Python? Explain with an example.
	•	How can you customize equality or immutability in data classes?

Algorithm Challenges
	1.	Matrix Manipulation
	•	Write a function to rotate an NxN matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.
	•	How would you efficiently find the shortest path in a maze represented as a 2D grid?
	2.	String Manipulation
	•	Write a function to check if one string is a permutation of another.
	•	How would you find the longest palindromic substring in a given string?
	3.	Dynamic Programming
	•	Implement a function to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount.
	•	Solve the longest increasing subsequence problem.
	4.	Concurrency
	•	Write a producer-consumer problem using Python’s threading or multiprocessing module.
	•	How can you use asyncio to handle multiple I/O-bound tasks simultaneously?
	5.	Tree and Graph Problems
	•	Write a function to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree.
	•	Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm in Python to find the shortest path in a graph.

Performance and Optimization
	1.	How would you profile a Python program to find bottlenecks?
	2.	Compare and contrast the performance of lists and tuples. When should you use one over the other?
	3.	How do you optimize a Python script for speed and memory usage?
	4.	What are the implications of mutable default arguments in function definitions? How can you avoid common pitfalls?

Libraries and Frameworks
	1.	Explain how NumPy handles broadcasting and how it improves performance.
	2.	What are the key differences between Python’s asyncio, threading, and multiprocessing modules?
	3.	How would you use Python’s collections module to implement an LRU cache?

Practical Code Challenges
	1.	Write a function to merge overlapping intervals.
	2.	Given a dictionary of words and a string s, write a function to determine if s can be segmented into space-separated dictionary words.
	3.	Implement a rate limiter using Python to limit the number of API calls a user can make in a certain time frame.
