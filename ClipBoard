So we’ve seen how the full Transformer with encoder and decoder works great for things like translation. But sometimes, you only need one half of it to get the job done.

That’s where the encoder shines all by itself — just like BERT.

BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, and it’s basically the Transformer’s encoder on steroids. It reads the whole sentence at once — both left to right and right to left — so it really gets what every word means in context.

Because of this, BERT is amazing for understanding language, whether it’s answering questions, figuring out sentiment, or other tasks where understanding is key.

For example, it can easily be turned into a classification model — like deciding if a review is positive or negative — just by adding a simple layer on top.

So, you can think of BERT as your super-smart language buddy who looks at the whole picture before making sense of it.”
