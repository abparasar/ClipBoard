Face comparison estimates how closely an applicant’s selfie matches the face on their ID. Mitek uses Rank One technology to generate a 0–100 similarity score, where scores below 80 indicate a non-match. Both a pass/fail flag and the score are returned via API. The model operates as an SDK, enabling Mitek to control version upgrades and conduct internal testing before integration; any unsatisfactory results delay deployment until vendor issues are resolved.
