To calculate the F1 score in Excel from two columns (actual values and predicted values), you’ll need to first calculate Precision and Recall, then use these to compute the F1 score.

Assume:

	•	Column A contains the actual values.
	•	Column B contains the predicted values.
	•	The positive class is "Positive" (replace with your actual positive class label if different).

1. Calculate Precision:

Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

=COUNTIFS(A2:A100, "Positive", B2:B100, "Positive") / COUNTIF(B2:B100, "Positive")

2. Calculate Recall:

Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

=COUNTIFS(A2:A100, "Positive", B2:B100, "Positive") / COUNTIF(A2:A100, "Positive")

3. Calculate F1 Score:

F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

If Precision is in cell C1 and Recall is in cell D1, the F1 score formula will be:

=2 * (C1 * D1) / (C1 + D1)

This will give you the F1 score based on the positive class in your data. Adjust the class name and ranges as needed for your specific case.
