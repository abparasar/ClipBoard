The Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov (KS) statistic is defined as the maximum absolute difference between the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the positive and negative classes:

\mathrm{KS} = \max_{x} \left| F_{1}(x) - F_{0}(x) \right|

where F_{1}(x) is the CDF of the positive (fraud) scores and F_{0}(x) is the CDF of the negative (non-fraud) scores.
