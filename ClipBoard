. The process verifies that the selfie is a natural photograph of a person’s face, not generated by AI tools or deepfake technologies, and that it hasn’t been manipulated by camera or software tampering. The Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) model, specifically IDLive™ Face developed by ID R&D, distinguishes between live and spoofed faces through advanced deep neural networks. It does not require user movement or specific actions, working instead on a single-frame selfie. The model assigns a probability score indicating whether the face is live or spoofed. The three key presentation attack types evaluated by PAD include video replay attacks (showing a prerecorded video to the camera), printed photo attacks (using static images or collages), and 3D mask attacks (using silicone or plastic masks to imitate a real person).
