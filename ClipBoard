Sure! Here’s a simple example of a Q&A task that uses an encoder-only model like BERT:

⸻

🤖 Encoder-Only Q&A Example

Context (Input Passage):
The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France. It was built in 1889 and is one of the most recognizable structures in the world.

Question:
Where is the Eiffel Tower located?

Answer (Extracted by Encoder Model):
Paris, France

⸻

🧠 How It Works:
	•	The encoder processes both the question and passage together.
	•	It computes contextual embeddings.
	•	It predicts the start and end positions of the answer span within the passage.

⚙️ Models like BERT, RoBERTa, or ALBERT are great at this, without needing a decoder!

Would you like a visual layout or want the same in a slide-ready format?



Great! Here’s the same Q&A example using a decoder-only model like GPT — this time in a generative format:

⸻

🗣️ Decoder-Only Q&A Example (Generative)

Input Prompt:
Answer the question based on the passage below.
Passage: The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France. It was built in 1889 and is one of the most recognizable structures in the world.
Question: Where is the Eiffel Tower located?

Generated Answer (by Decoder Model):
The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France.

⸻

🧠 How It Works:
	•	The decoder reads the entire prompt (passage + question) as one sequence.
	•	It generates the answer token-by-token.
	•	No need to predict start/end spans — it just “writes” the answer.

⚙️ Used in GPT, LLaMA, Falcon, and other generative models.

Let me know if you want a side-by-side visual slide or analogy (like “BERT finds it, GPT says it”).
