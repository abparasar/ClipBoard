This approach is effective in justifying the number of rank order breaks because it strikes a balance between being sensitive to changes in model performance and avoiding overreaction to minor fluctuations. By categorizing the breaks based on their frequency and impact, it provides a clear, data-driven framework that accounts for the dynamic nature of fraud patterns.
	•	Green (≤ 2 breaks): This recognizes that minor shifts are common in dynamic environments, allowing the model to adapt without unnecessary alarm.
	•	Yellow (3-4 breaks): This is a middle ground, indicating that more noticeable shifts should prompt investigation without prematurely concluding that there is a serious issue.
	•	Red (≥ 5 breaks): This flags significant performance issues, where the model’s ability to accurately identify fraud may be compromised, ensuring that immediate action is taken.

This approach ensures that you avoid flagging irrelevant shifts, focus on potential impactful changes, and direct attention to critical performance issues in a structured manner, which ultimately helps maintain model stability and fraud detection effectiveness.
