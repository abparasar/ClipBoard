Here’s a crisp five-pointer summary of the five data analysis elements:
	1.	Current Transaction Signals – Analyze real-time details such as amount, time, location, merchant, and device/IP to detect anomalies.
	2.	Pivoted Historical Behavior – Distill past transactions by card and device into behavioral patterns, linking merchants, locations, and device-card relationships.
	3.	Dynamic Self-Learning Variables – Use mini-models to track shifts in spending velocity, repeat purchases, and new device usage in real time.
	4.	Historical Risk Tables – Leverage fraud vs. legitimate transaction trends and probabilities derived from large-scale historical data.
	5.	Non-Linear Scoring Models – Combine all factors into advanced models that balance risky indicators with mitigating behaviors to produce a fraud risk score.

Do you want me to make this summary executive-style (one line each, management-friendly) or technical-style (with PSD2 compliance emphasis)?
