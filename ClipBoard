Self-attention is like a sentence talking to itself to figure out which words go together, while encoder-decoder attention is like the new sentence asking the old sentence for help to make sense


.I believe you’re asking for an explanation of the encoder-decoder attention mechanism in a transformer model, similar to how self-attention was explained in the image, but with a simplified calculation flow. Since the image showed self-attention with specific values, I’ll adapt that style to demonstrate encoder-decoder attention using a small example. I’ll also keep the language simple and the response concise for mobile readability, as requested.

Let’s use a small example to explain encoder-decoder attention. Imagine the encoder processes the input sentence “GO SIMRAN” and the decoder is generating the output sentence “RUN SIMRAN.” Encoder-decoder attention helps the decoder focus on the encoder’s outputs while generating each word in the output.
Step-by-Step Flow
	1	Encoder Outputs (Keys and Values): The encoder has already processed “GO SIMRAN.” Each word gets a Key and Value vector:
	◦	“GO”: Key = 1.5, Value = 11.7
	◦	“SIMRAN”: Key = 1.0, Value = -2.3
	2	Decoder Input (Query): The decoder is generating the word “RUN” in “RUN SIMRAN.” It has a Query vector for “RUN”:
	◦	“RUN”: Query = 1.2
	3	Dot Product (Similarity): The decoder compares its Query with the encoder’s Keys to see which input words are relevant:
	◦	Query (“RUN”: 1.2) × Key (“GO”: 1.5) = 1.2 × 1.5 = 1.8
	◦	Query (“RUN”: 1.2) × Key (“SIMRAN”: 1.0) = 1.2 × 1.0 = 1.2
	4	Scale the Scores: To avoid large values, the scores are scaled (divided by a factor, say √2 ≈ 1.4 for simplicity):
	◦	“GO”: 1.8 ÷ 1.4 ≈ 1.3
	◦	“SIMRAN”: 1.2 ÷ 1.4 ≈ 0.9
	5	Softmax (Attention Weights): The scaled scores are turned into weights that add up to 1 using softmax:
	◦	“GO”: e^1.3 ≈ 3.67, “SIMRAN”: e^0.9 ≈ 2.46
	◦	Total = 3.67 + 2.46 = 6.13
	◦	Weight for “GO”: 3.67 ÷ 6.13 ≈ 0.6
	◦	Weight for “SIMRAN”: 2.46 ÷ 6.13 ≈ 0.4
	6	Weighted Sum (Output): The decoder combines the encoder’s Values using these weights:
	◦	Value (“GO”: 11.7) × 0.6 = 7.02
	◦	Value (“SIMRAN”: -2.3) × 0.4 = -0.92
	◦	Final output for “RUN”: 7.02 + (-0.92) = 6.1
Summary
Encoder-decoder attention lets the decoder (generating “RUN”) focus on the encoder’s words (“GO” and “SIMRAN”). “RUN” pays more attention to “GO” (weight 0.6) than “SIMRAN” (weight 0.4), creating a new value (6.1) to help generate the output. This process repeats for each word the decoder generates, ensuring it uses the right context from the input.
