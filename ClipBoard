To calculate the F1 score along with the entailment ratio, we need to consider both the precision and recall for the entailment class. Here is a detailed explanation using the hypothetical banking example provided earlier.

### Hypothetical Example:

| Premise                            | Hypothesis                         | Ground Truth Label | Model Prediction |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| "The bank is closed on Sundays."   | "The bank is not open on Sundays." | Entailment         | Entailment       |
| "The customer deposited $500."     | "The customer withdrew $500."      | Contradiction      | Contradiction    |
| "The ATM is out of service."       | "The ATM is not working."          | Entailment         | Neutral          |
| "She has a savings account."       | "She has a checking account."      | Neutral            | Contradiction    |
| "The loan was approved."           | "The loan was denied."             | Contradiction      | Contradiction    |
| "Interest rates have increased."   | "Borrowing is more expensive now." | Entailment         | Entailment       |

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Count True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN) for Entailment:**

   - **True Positives (TP):** Hypotheses correctly predicted as entailment.
     - Premise 1: Hypothesis 1
     - Premise 6: Hypothesis 1
     - Total TP = 2

   - **False Positives (FP):** Hypotheses incorrectly predicted as entailment.
     - None
     - Total FP = 0

   - **False Negatives (FN):** Hypotheses incorrectly predicted as not entailment (neutral or contradiction).
     - Premise 3: Hypothesis 1
     - Total FN = 1

2. **Calculate Precision and Recall for Entailment:**

   - **Precision:** \( \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}} \)

     \[ \text{Precision} = \frac{2}{2 + 0} = 1 \]

   - **Recall:** \( \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}} \)

     \[ \text{Recall} = \frac{2}{2 + 1} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]

3. **Calculate F1 Score:**

   - **F1 Score:** \( \text{F1} = \frac{2 \times \text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} \)

     \[ \text{F1} = \frac{2 \times 1 \times 0.67}{1 + 0.67} = \frac{1.34}{1.67} \approx 0.80 \]

### Calculate the Entailment Ratio:

- **Total Premise-Hypothesis Pairs:** 6
- **Correct Entailment Predictions:** 2

\[ \text{Entailment Ratio} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

### Summary:

- **Total Premise-Hypothesis Pairs:** 6
- **Correct Entailment Predictions:** 2
- **Entailment Ratio:** 0.33
- **Precision (Entailment):** 1.00
- **Recall (Entailment):** 0.67
- **F1 Score (Entailment):** 0.80

These calculations provide insight into the performance of the model with respect to identifying entailments. The entailment ratio gives an overall sense of how often the model correctly identifies entailments, while the F1 score balances precision and recall, providing a more nuanced measure of performance for this specific class.
