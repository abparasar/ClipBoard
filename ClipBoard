It appears there isn’t an official, standardized exam called the “Reg CC exam” universally administered—what you’re likely referring to is a training or compliance assessment focusing on Regulation CC, also simply known as Reg CC.

What Is Reg CC?

Regulation CC is a U.S. federal regulation that governs how quickly banks and other depository institutions must make certain deposited funds available to their customers and outlines the procedures for clearing checks. It implements the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) of 1987 and incorporates elements from the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (Check 21) of 2003  ￼ ￼ ￼.

Key Provisions:
	•	Funds Availability Rules: Specifies maximum hold periods for different types of deposits so that customers know when they can access funds  ￼ ￼.
	•	Disclosure Requirements: Banks must clearly inform customers about their funds availability policies and any holds being placed  ￼ ￼.
	•	Check-Clearing Procedures: Enhances the speed and safety of check processing using electronic systems and substitute checks  ￼.
	•	Types of Holds: Institutions can place holds for various reasons (e.g., new accounts, large deposits, suspected fraud) with specific regulatory guidelines  ￼ ￼ ￼.
	•	Compliance & Training: Institutions must maintain internal controls, training programs, recordkeeping procedures, and disclosure practices to comply with Reg CC  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼.

What Is a “Reg CC Exam”?

Though there’s no single, formal “Reg CC exam” recognized nationwide, many financial institutions—including banks and credit unions—do conduct internal evaluations, training sessions, or compliance quizzes. These typically cover:
	•	Funds availability schedules and permissible hold times (e.g., next-day availability, standard hold periods for different deposit types).
	•	Proper disclosure practices and notice timing.
	•	Different types of holds (e.g., exception holds, case-by-case holds, large-deposit holds, new-account holds).
	•	Recordkeeping and compliance monitoring.
	•	Scenarios involving suspected fraud or other risk-based exceptions.

These internal assessments may go by names such as “Reg CC training quiz,” “Reg CC exam,” or “funds availability assessment”  ￼ ￼. There are even study materials and flashcard sets—some tailored to training staff, others designed to prepare for regulatory exams—that similarly use the name “Reg CC exam”  ￼ ￼.

Summary Table

Topic	Description
Reg CC (Regulation CC)	Federal rule governing funds availability, check handling, disclosures, and holds.
EFAA	Expedited Funds Availability Act of 1987 (Reg CC implements it).
Check 21	Act enabling legal use of electronically processed substitute checks, incorporated into Reg CC.
“Reg CC Exam”	Typically an internal compliance test or training tool for staff on Reg CC rules. Not a formal industry-wide exam.
Training Tools	Flashcards, quizzes, evaluation templates, and online courses used in compliance training  ￼ ￼ ￼.

In a Nutshell

If someone refers to a Reg CC exam, they likely mean a compliance training exercise or internal test designed to ensure personnel understand and can properly apply the requirements of Regulation CC. It’s not an official credential but a practical method for institutions to assess and reinforce compliance with funds availability regulations.

In a Nutshell

If someone refers to a Reg CC exam, they likely mean a compliance training exercise or internal test designed to ensure personnel understand and can properly apply the requirements of Regulation CC. It’s not an official credential but a practical method for institutions to assess and reinforce compliance with funds availability regulations.







The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) plays a supervisory and enforcement role in Regulation CC compliance for national banks and federal savings associations, including oversight of deposit models that determine funds availability and check hold periods.

Here’s how it fits together:

⸻

1. OCC’s Regulatory Authority over Reg CC
	•	Primary Regulator for National Banks & Federal Savings Associations
The OCC ensures these institutions comply with Reg CC requirements (funds availability, disclosures, check processing timelines, etc.).
	•	Enforcement Powers
If an OCC exam finds that a bank’s deposit policies or models violate Reg CC (e.g., holding funds too long without valid exceptions), the OCC can issue:
	•	Matters Requiring Attention (MRA)
	•	Cease-and-desist orders
	•	Civil money penalties
	•	Guidance
OCC examiners rely on the FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – Reg CC section (even for OCC institutions) and the Comptroller’s Handbook on Deposit-Related Credit to evaluate compliance.

⸻

2. Role in Deposit Models

Deposit models here generally mean internal bank systems or algorithms used to:
	•	Decide hold times for deposited items.
	•	Predict risk of returns/fraud and assign exceptions under Reg CC.
	•	Segment customers by account history, deposit type, or fraud risk.

OCC’s role is to:
	1.	Review Model Governance
	•	Ensure banks have model risk management in line with OCC Bulletin 2011-12 / SR 11-7 (model risk governance).
	•	Confirm appropriate validation, documentation, and oversight for any automated hold-decision systems.
	2.	Evaluate Regulatory Compliance
	•	Check that model outputs match Reg CC’s maximum permissible hold periods (e.g., 2 business days for most local checks, exception holds up to 7 days).
	•	Review whether exception holds (large deposit, new account, redeposited check, repeated overdrafts, reasonable cause to doubt collectibility) are correctly triggered.
	3.	Assess Fairness & Consumer Impact
	•	OCC examiners ensure no unfair or deceptive practices in how the model applies holds.
	•	Verify that disclosures match actual hold practices.
	4.	Test Model Accuracy
	•	Compare model decisions against manual calculation scenarios to detect systematic over-holding or bias.
	•	Review exception override logs.

⸻

3. OCC Examination Activities

During a Reg CC review, OCC examiners may:
	•	Sample deposit transactions to verify the system’s hold period matches regulation.
	•	Review model documentation to see how it determines availability dates.
	•	Check for timely notices to customers when holds exceed standard availability.
	•	Evaluate operational controls around changes to model parameters.
	•	Assess training of front-line staff on Reg CC rules and system outputs.

⸻

4. Why This Matters

A bank’s deposit model can become a compliance risk if:
	•	It’s calibrated too conservatively (holding funds longer than allowed without exceptions).
	•	Exception hold logic is poorly coded or undocumented.
	•	Changes aren’t validated, leading to systemic violations.
	•	Model bias affects certain customer segments disproportionately.

OCC’s job is to make sure the bank’s model risk management and consumer compliance intersect correctly—ensuring the bank both manages fraud risk and adheres strictly to Reg CC timelines.

If you want, I can map out a flowchart showing how OCC examiners trace a deposit model’s decision path to Reg CC compliance—that’s the visual they actually use in some model risk reviews.
