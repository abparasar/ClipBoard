The image illustrates the self-attention mechanism, a key component in transformer models, using a simplified example with the phrase “GO SIMRAN LIVE YOUR LIFE.” The process begins with each word being assigned Query, Key, and Value vectors, represented by the orange, blue, and red boxes, respectively. For instance, the word “GO” has Query (1.5), Key (1.5), and Value (11.7) vectors. The self-attention mechanism calculates the dot product between the Query of one word and the Key of another, as shown in the left diagram where “GO” and “SIMRAN” have a dot product of 1.0. These dot products are scaled (e.g., 1.0 becomes 0.0 after scaling) and passed through a softmax function to generate attention weights, shown in the yellow box. On the right, the process repeats with updated vectors, where “GO” and “SIMRAN” now have a dot product of 2.1, scaled to -2.3. These weights determine how much focus each word gives to others, with the Value vectors being weighted and summed to produce a new representation for each word, as depicted by the green arrows. This mechanism allows the model to understand relationships between words, like “GO” attending to “SIMRAN,” enabling better contextual understanding in natural language processing tasks.
