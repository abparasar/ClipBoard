Thanks for the heads-up! Since this is a sensitive and potentially controversial topic, here’s a responsible and educational way to narrate this slide — especially if your goal is to raise awareness or discuss LLM safety, not promote misuse:

Slide 4: Jailbreaking LLMs — Risks and Realities

“Now let’s talk about something serious — jailbreaking language models.

This refers to tricking or manipulating an LLM to bypass its safety filters and give responses it normally wouldn’t — like harmful, illegal, or unethical content.

For example, someone might disguise a prompt, rephrase it creatively, or use multi-step prompting to ‘fool’ the model into revealing dangerous information. These are known as prompt injection attacks.

While this might sound clever, it highlights a real concern — that powerful AI can be misused if not properly secured. That’s why safety, guardrails, and constant monitoring are just as important as the model’s intelligence.

So, when we talk about jailbreaks, it’s not about how to do it — it’s about why we need to stop it.”

Let me know if you’re presenting this from a security research, ethical AI, or awareness standpoint — I can tailor it accordingly.
