# Initialize the WebDriver (make sure the driver for your browser is installed)
driver = webdriver.Edge()  # You can replace Edge with Chrome/Firefox, etc.

# Open the URL
url = "https://example.com"
driver.get(url)

# Example: Extract the title of the page
title = driver.title
print("Title of the page:", title)

# If you need other content, you can use various Selenium commands, e.g., 
# driver.find_element(By.XPATH, 'xpath').text to get specific content

# Don't forget to close the driver when done
driver.quit()
