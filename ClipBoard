Absolutely! Here’s a casual, clear narration broken down for your three slides on a decoder-based chat GPT:

⸻

Slide 1: Masked Self-Attention Example

“Alright, now let’s switch gears and look at the decoder side — like in ChatGPT.

Here, the decoder uses something called masked self-attention. Think of it as reading the sentence one word at a time, but never peeking ahead. It can only look at the words it’s already generated or been given. This keeps the generation honest and prevents it from ‘cheating’ by seeing the future words before it creates them.”

Slide 2: Input Prompt Encoding

“So when you type a prompt, the decoder starts by encoding it — basically turning your input into a format it can understand. It uses the words it’s already seen to predict what comes next, step by step.”

⸻

Slide 3: Response Generation

“Then, the decoder generates the response one word at a time. After creating each word, it looks back at everything generated so far (using that masked self-attention) to decide what to say next. This way, it builds a coherent and relevant answer, just like a smart conversation partner.”

Would you like me to make it even more conversational or add a simple analogy?
