To calculate the F1 score and micro F1 score for entailment verification using LLMs, follow these steps:

### Definitions:
- **Precision:** The number of true positive (TP) entailment predictions divided by the total number of positive predictions (TP + FP).
- **Recall:** The number of true positive (TP) entailment predictions divided by the total number of actual positives (TP + FN).
- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Micro F1 Score:** A measure that aggregates the contributions of all classes to compute the average F1 score.

### Example Data:

| Premise                        | Hypothesis                  | Ground Truth | Model Prediction |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| "The sky is clear."            | "It is not raining."        | Entailment   | Entailment       |
| "She is reading a book."       | "She is studying."          | Neutral      | Neutral          |
| "The ground is wet."           | "It has rained."            | Entailment   | Contradiction    |
| "He is eating breakfast."      | "He is eating eggs."        | Neutral      | Entailment       |
| "The cat is sleeping."         | "The cat is not awake."     | Entailment   | Entailment       |

### Steps for Calculation:

1. **Identify True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN):**

   - **TP (Entailment):** Correctly predicted entailment pairs.
     - Pairs: "The sky is clear." -> "It is not raining." and "The cat is sleeping." -> "The cat is not awake."
     - Count: 2
   - **FP (Entailment):** Pairs incorrectly predicted as entailment.
     - Pair: "He is eating breakfast." -> "He is eating eggs."
     - Count: 1
   - **FN (Entailment):** Actual entailment pairs missed by the model.
     - Pair: "The ground is wet." -> "It has rained."
     - Count: 1

2. **Calculate Precision and Recall for Entailment:**

\[ \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \frac{2}{2 + 1} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]

\[ \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \frac{2}{2 + 1} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]

3. **Calculate F1 Score for Entailment:**

\[ \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} = 2 \times \frac{0.67 \times 0.67}{0.67 + 0.67} = 2 \times \frac{0.4489}{1.34} \approx 0.67 \]

4. **Micro F1 Score Calculation:**
   - The micro F1 score is calculated by considering all instances across classes.
   - Compute total TP, FP, and FN across all classes and use these to calculate precision, recall, and F1.

   **Total TP:** 2 (Entailment) + 1 (Neutral) = 3

   **Total FP:** 1 (Entailment) + 0 (Neutral) = 1

   **Total FN:** 1 (Entailment) + 0 (Neutral) = 1

   **Micro Precision:**

\[ \text{Micro Precision} = \frac{\text{Total TP}}{\text{Total TP} + \text{Total FP}} = \frac{3}{3 + 1} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \]

   **Micro Recall:**

\[ \text{Micro Recall} = \frac{\text{Total TP}}{\text{Total TP} + \text{Total FN}} = \frac{3}{3 + 1} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \]

   **Micro F1 Score:**

\[ \text{Micro F1} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Micro Precision} \times \text{Micro Recall}}{\text{Micro Precision} + \text{Micro Recall}} = 2 \times \frac{0.75 \times 0.75}{0.75 + 0.75} = 2 \times \frac{0.5625}{1.5} = 0.75 \]

### Summary:

- **F1 Score (Entailment):** 0.67
- **Micro F1 Score:** 0.75

These calculations provide insights into the model's performance in identifying entailments correctly, balancing precision, and recall for a holistic evaluation.
