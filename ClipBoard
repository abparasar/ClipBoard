To manually download rouge.py and bertscore.py (used by Hugging Face’s evaluate library), follow these steps. These are stored in the Hugging Face evaluation module repository.

✅ Step-by-step Manual Download Instructions

🔹 1. Go to the GitHub repository:

The evaluation modules are hosted here:
👉 https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate/tree/main/metrics

🔹 2. Locate the metric you want:
	•	ROUGE:
https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate/blob/main/metrics/rouge/rouge.py
	•	BERTScore:
https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate/blob/main/metrics/bertscore/bertscore.py

🔹 3. Download the files

You can:
	•	Click “Raw”, then right-click → Save As, or
	•	Use wget:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/evaluate/main/metrics/rouge/rouge.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/evaluate/main/metrics/bertscore/bertscore.py

🔹 4. Download their __init__.py (optional but recommended)

Some metrics also use an __init__.py in the same folder. If you’re running them manually, you might want to fetch it too from:
	•	metrics/rouge/__init__.py
	•	metrics/bertscore/__init__.py

✅ How to use downloaded metric manually

Put the file in a local folder like ./custom_metrics/rouge/rouge.py, then:

from evaluate import load

rouge = load("./custom_metrics/rouge")

Make sure the folder has:

custom_metrics/
└── rouge/
    ├── rouge.py
    └── __init__.py (optional but safer)

Same process for bertscore.

🧠 Tip

These metrics might also require extra dependencies:

pip install rouge-score
pip install bert-score
