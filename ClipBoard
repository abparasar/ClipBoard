Deepfake Attack Detection (DFD) identifies AI-generated or manipulated selfies, including face swaps, synthetics, and digitally altered images. It analyzes the selfie and outputs a probability from 0 (deepfake) to 100 (live), with 50 as the threshold for authenticity. Scores below 50 are flagged as deepfakes, while 50 or above are classified as live.
