To calculate the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic, Gini coefficient, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) from your Excel data, you can use the following Python code. This code uses `pandas` for data manipulation and `scikit-learn` for computing AUC and Gini. You'll need to have these libraries installed (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, and `openpyxl` for reading Excel files).

First, make sure you have these libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy openpyxl
```

Then, use the following Python script:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc

# Load the data
file_path = 'x.xlsx'  # Make sure your file is named correctly
sheet_name = 'y'

df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name)

# Assuming your dataframe has the following columns: 'score', 'good', 'fraud'
# Calculate total good and fraud transactions
total_good = df['good'].sum()
total_fraud = df['fraud'].sum()

# Calculate cumulative good and fraud transactions
df['cum_good'] = df['good'].cumsum()
df['cum_fraud'] = df['fraud'].cumsum()

# Calculate KS statistic
df['cum_good_perc'] = df['cum_good'] / total_good
df['cum_fraud_perc'] = df['cum_fraud'] / total_fraud
df['ks_statistic'] = df['cum_fraud_perc'] - df['cum_good_perc']
ks_statistic = df['ks_statistic'].max()

# Calculate AUC
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(df['fraud'], df['score'])
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

# Calculate Gini coefficient
gini = 2 * roc_auc - 1

print(f'KS Statistic: {ks_statistic}')
print(f'AUC: {roc_auc}')
print(f'Gini Coefficient: {gini}')
```

This script performs the following steps:

1. Load the data from the Excel file.
2. Calculate cumulative good and fraud transactions.
3. Compute the KS statistic.
4. Compute the ROC curve and AUC.
5. Calculate the Gini coefficient.

Make sure to replace `file_path` and `sheet_name` with your actual file and sheet names. Save the script as a `.py` file and run it in your Python environment.

If you have any specific requirements for the columns or data structure, let me know, and I can adjust the code accordingly.
