Here’s a refined and analytically balanced rephrasing:

⸻

“While Model X outperforms the others, it’s important to note that the target variable used for fine-tuning was generated by Model X itself. This introduces a potential bias, as the model may be inherently aligned with the patterns it helped create, which could partially explain its superior performance.”

⸻

🔍 Optional Additions for Depth (if needed):
	•	“This self-reinforcement effect should be considered when interpreting the results, as it may not generalize to externally labeled or unbiased datasets.”
	•	“An independent labeling process would be necessary to validate the performance advantage more objectively.”

Would you like this to be more formal, casual, or tailored for a research paper or internal report?
