If you mean “X equals y and z divided by a and b” you can write it in LaTeX like this:

X = \frac{y \;\text{and}\; z}{a \;\text{and}\; b}

If instead you intend two separate equalities, write:

X = y \quad\text{and}\quad X = \frac{z}{a \; b}

—or, if you mean two fractions:

X = \frac{y}{a} \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{z}{b}

(Choose the version that matches your intended meaning.)
